# Python Scripting Challenges: Analysis on Jupyter Notebook

This repository contains two Python scripts that analyze financial records and election polling data using Jupyter Notebooks. The scripts demonstrate data analysis techniques and provide insights into financial performance and election results.

## Overview

### PyBank Financial Records Analysis

The PyBank analysis script performs the following tasks:
- Calculates the total number of months included in the dataset.
- Computes the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Analyzes the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and calculates the average of these changes.
- Identifies the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- Identifies the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

### PyPoll Election Data Analysis

The PyPoll analysis script performs the following tasks:
- Calculates the total number of votes cast.
- Compiles a complete list of candidates who received votes.
- Computes the percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Calculates the total number of votes each candidate won.
- Determines the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Installation

To run the analysis scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python_Scripting_Challenges.git
   cd Python_Scripting_Challenges
   
2. Install the required dependencies:

    The required dependencies are listed in the Jupyter notebooks. You can install them using pip:
   pip install pandas

3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks:

  jupyter notebook NickNathmodule3pypoll.ipynb
  jupyter notebook nicknath_module3_homework_12102023.ipynb

##Usage
PyBank Analysis
Open the nicknath_module3_homework_12102023.ipynb notebook and run the cells to perform the financial records analysis. The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations of each step.

PyPoll Analysis
Open the NickNathmodule3pypoll.ipynb notebook and run the cells to perform the election data analysis. The notebook includes detailed comments and explanations of each step.

##Results
PyBank Analysis Results
The script provides the following results:

Total number of months included in the dataset.
Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
Average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
Greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).
PyPoll Analysis Results
The script provides the following results:

Total number of votes cast.
Percentage of votes each candidate won.
Total number of votes each candidate won.
Winner of the election based on popular vote.
